> * Project Title: Influence of casual relationships through social discovery on epidemics

## General Introduction

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
Simulations are a fundamental tool to understand the spread of infectious diseases in populations. It depends of course on the chosen model, that is how accurately it represents the real world, which conclusions may be drawn from such a simulation. In this work, we would like to consider the emergence of social discovery platforms such as Tinder. Due to such platforms finding a date outside of one's circle of acquaintances has become easier and thereby more common. This opens new ways for spread of infectious diseases.
(Add real-world examples, if any)
Recently, government agencies of Rhode Island, USA blamed Tinder for the dramatic increase in cases of sexual transmittable diseases (STD's), e.g. 79% increase of Syphilis.
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)
The structure or connectivity of a social network depicting society is one thing influencing epidemics, but behavior has immense impact as well [Funk, 2009]. Behavior may for example decrease the infection rate due to higher awareness of hygiene or might alter the network structure because sick people are avoided. Individual behavior is a result of available information. The propagation of information has a different, though coupled dynamic than the spread of disease. The introduction of social discovery has impact on both respective dynamics.

## The Model

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abstraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)
The structure of the network depicting society is one thing influencing epidemics, but behavior has great impact too [Funk, 2009]

## Fundamental Questions

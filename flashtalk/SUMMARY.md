“social discovery” = platforms suggesting products, people, etc. based on personal info

various epidemics models exist:
*	SIS/SIR/SEIR in mean field approximation (last week)
*	vaccination – game theory to account for different strategies; suggests that we need high level of vaccination uptake, i.e. *herd immunity*
*	network based – treat network heterogeneities
*	info network – additional info inhibits spreading of disease, updates strategies; suggests an alternative approach to herd immunity
*	Olivia: dynamics of disease/info networks

governmental agencies now claim rise in STDs due to hookup apps like Tinder (which is instance of “social discovery” tools)

in existing models:
disease/info spread strictly locally just within neighbors in contact network
our approach:
disease may spread “non-locally” over large distance in contact network, i.e. via 2nd channel

what we hope to find:
*	introducing the 2nd spreading channel: does it generally change the way a disease spreads or is this effect negligible? does it maybe depend on the type of disease (i.e. parameters)?
* to which magnitude does behavior on Tinder change spreading of diseases? are claims really related to increase in use of *social discovery apps* or is this a feature of a generally different sexual behaviour?
